Sections
There are three sections, which can be found by looking for the key "section". The convention for naming sections is to use the two main words and connect them with a hyphen, shortening the words where necessary. The section titles and their shortened references are as follows:
1 - Understanding Risk (understand-risk)
2 - Operational Security (op-sec)
3 - Device & Account Security (devices-accounts)

Subsections
Aside from the section title and its shortened reference, each section contains a key called "subs". This contains an array of multiple subsections, where each subsection is referred to by a two-word hyphenated key - as demonstrated below:
1 - Understanding Risk (understand-risk)
    - About Your Organization (your-org)
    - External Threats (external-threats)

    - Policy & Documentation
    - Internal Risks
